# Note:

Since one of the datasets (energy consumption dataset) is too large, we use Git lfs to upload
it. The GitHub IO page may not read this large file online. This cause the first interactive map
on our website with the GitHub IO page cannot be displayed.

And if you download the whole website file on GitHub, the large datasets will be not
downloaded with the whole file. To make the website work correctly, please download the file
“data.js” with the link (https://github.com/VON-N1NE/CASA0003---Group-Mini-Project-Digital-Visualisation/raw/main/5.27finalmap/hanzheng_map/hanzheng/data.js), and put it in the directory (5.27finalmap\hanzheng_map\hanzheng)
manually.
